# EvonyVotingApp

Its a voting app for Evony based on pyEvony. For this app to work, price of some resource in the market has to be less than 0.05. Add that resource as resource name below. vote.py can be used from command line by using:-

	python vote.py server resourcename voteguy
	
voteapp.py is the GUI for using vote.py

The compiled versions are in the release folder. Download the folder and run voteapp.exe for using it.

**If anyone downloaded a previous version of the voting app, clean your temp folder, the vote.exe file was creating temp files everytime it ran. The temp folder is usually located at C:\Users\username\Appdata\Local\Temp**

**This has been fixed in the latest version**
